# Testing guide

The [`testing` example](../../examples/testing/docs.md) illustrates how to run unit-like assertions from within a script using the `test` module.

## Run the tests
1. Select **Koto Tests** in the explorer and execute the script.
2. Watch stdout to follow along as each test runs; the final return value summarises the counter state.
3. Inspect `examples/testing/logs/test_run.log` to see the log output generated by the hooks.

## Experiment further
- Add new `@test` entries to the `tests` map to expand the suite.
- Modify `@pre_test` and `@post_test` hooks to set up fixtures or clean up resources.
- Combine this workflow with serialization to export test results for reporting.
